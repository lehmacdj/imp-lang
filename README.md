# IMP
An implementation of a very basic imperative language.

The language has support for basic arithmetic and boolean operations, integer
variables, print statements, if statements, and while loops.

This project builds an executable `impi` which launches an interpreter for
programs in the language. To run it do:
```
stack build && stack exec impi
```
